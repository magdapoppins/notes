# GitHub Actions as CI

## Overview

- Actions are defined per project in a .github/workflows/ - in the same file you can also have e.g. pull request templates
- A single action can be for example linting, a test suite or building the application, and you can define at which points in time it runs (push, merge, pull request...) and for which branches
